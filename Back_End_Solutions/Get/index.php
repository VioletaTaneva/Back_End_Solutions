Meeting at internships in Japan.
When applying for internships in Japan, it’s crucial to tailor your resume and cover letter to meet Japanese business standards. Highlighting soft skills such as adaptability and professionalism alongside technical skills relevant to the job can set your application apart.

Understanding the corporate culture and how to effectively communicate your alignment with company values and expectations can significantly enhance your application. Employers in Japan appreciate detailed, well-structured resumes and cover letters that not only showcase your qualifications but also your cultural fluency and understanding of Japanese work ethics​. For in-depth insights into Japanese business culture refer to our article Japanese Business Etiquette.  

What Are the Legal Requirements for Doing Internships in Japan?
To intern in Japan, understanding the visa requirements is crucial. Interns generally require a “Designated Activities Visa” if the internship is paid, whereas unpaid internships may necessitate a “Cultural Activities Visa“. These visas are defined by the specific activities and duration of the internship. For instance, the Designated Activities Visa is often applied for roles that include paid internships in companies or organizations within Japan​.

It’s important to note that if you are already in Japan on a student visa, then you have certain restrictions concerning paid internships. Students are allowed to work part-time for up to 28 hours per week during term time and full-time during vacations. However, any form of employment, including internships, must be reported and approved by the immigration office where the student will receive a “Permission to Engage in Activity other than that Permitted under the Status of Residence Previously Granted”.

What Do You Need to Know About Work Permits?
For foreign nationals, working legally in Japan involves obtaining the correct work permit. Depending on the nature of the internship, a Technical Intern Training Visa might be required, especially for internships that involve acquiring specific skills or professional training. This visa is typically organized through the sponsoring organization in Japan and is structured in phases (Technical Intern Training (i) for the first year and potentially extending to Technical Intern Training (ii) for subsequent years if conditions are met)​. 

The process for applying for these visas involves submitting a detailed application including a training plan and proof of professional qualifications, among other documents. It’s important to start this process well in advance of your intended start date, as obtaining a visa can take several months. Moreover, securing a visa often requires coordination with your host organization in Japan, which must provide specific documentation to support your application​.

What Is Life Like Doing Internships in Japan?
Life as an intern in japan.
Adjusting to Japanese culture is both an enriching and challenging experience. Common cultural practices include punctuality, respect for hierarchy, and the observance of social etiquette that may seem intricate to outsiders. For example, it is customary to arrive at work earlier than your scheduled time and participate in morning assemblies known as “chourei” (朝礼, Kana: ちょうれい) or morning greetings​​.

Understanding these cultural aspects can significantly ease the adjustment process. Engaging with the culture—not just passively observing—can help narrow the cultural gap. This might involve participating in local traditions, learning basic Japanese phrases, or even joining in communal activities like “rajio taisō” (ラジオ体操) or radio exercises often conducted in workplaces​. 

How Do You Manage Day-To-Day Living?
Managing daily life as an intern in Japan involves several practical considerations, from finding accommodation to handling living expenses. Housing options vary widely, from shared apartments often provided by employers to private accommodations found through real estate listings or referrals from acquaintances. It’s important to consider the cost of living, which can be quite high in major cities like Tokyo and Osaka. Interns should budget carefully, considering expenses for food, transportation, and social activities​.

Socializing often revolves around after-work activities such as “nomikai” (飲み会) or drinking parties, which play a critical role in team bonding and networking in Japanese business culture. While these gatherings are fun and integral to social integration, they come with their own set of etiquettes, such as allowing others to pour your drinks​​.

With the right preparation and open-mindedness, it can be a rewarding experience, offering insights into both professional and personal growth. For those planning to intern in Japan, embracing the country’s rich cultural tapestry and understanding its social norms are crucial steps toward a successful stint abroad.

        "title" => "Comparing East and West German Attitudes 30 Years After the Berlin Wall",
        "date" => "October 18, 2019",
        "content" => "Three decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall, people in former West and East Germany overwhelmingly say the unification of their country was a positive development, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. Large majorities in both areas say the changes that have unfolded in Germany since 1989 have had a good influence on living standards, health care and national pride, and most also see improvements in areas including family values, spiritual values and law and order.


On a personal level, too, Germans are happier with their lives, according to the survey, which was conducted in spring 2019 among representative samples of adults in the pre-1990 Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and former German Democratic Republic (East Germany). Majorities in both areas now place themselves at 7 or higher on a 10-point “ladder” of life satisfaction, where 10 represents the best possible life. When Pew Research Center asked the life satisfaction question in 1991 and 2009, no more than roughly half in either area placed themselves in this top tier. The increase has been especially dramatic in the former East, where the share who rate their lives at 7 or higher has almost quadrupled from just 15% in 1991 to 59% this year.

Despite widespread positive sentiments among Germans about the changes of the past 30 years, the perspectives of those in the former West and East still differ in some notable ways. Here is a look at some of the areas where these differences are most pronounced.

People in the former West are more satisfied than those in the former East with the way things are going in their country today, including the performance of Germany’s democracy. Around six-in-ten adults in former West Germany (61%) are satisfied with the way things are going in Germany, compared with 37% who are dissatisfied. Opinion is more evenly divided in former East Germany, where 50% are satisfied and 47% are not.

When it comes to the way Germany’s democracy is working, around two-thirds of those in the former West (66%) are satisfied, compared with a narrower 55% majority among those in the former East.



On a variety of measures, those in the former West are more optimistic about the future than their counterparts in the former East. More in the former West say they are optimistic than pessimistic when it comes to the education system (57% optimistic vs. 41% pessimistic) and how the nation’s political system works (53% vs. 45%). In the former East, people tend to be more pessimistic than optimistic in both of these areas.

People in the former West are also more likely than those in the former East (50% vs. 42%) to say children today will be better off financially than their parents when they grow up.

Attitudes toward the EU are more positive in the former West than in the former East. Germans are generally pro-European Union, but the share of adults who have a favorable view of the EU is higher in the former West than in the former East (72% vs. 59%). Similarly, three-quarters of those in the former West say Germany’s membership in the EU is a good thing, compared with 62% of those in the former East.



People living in the former East are twice as likely as those in the former West to have a favorable opinion of the country’s right-wing populist party, Alternative for Germany (AfD). While its nationwide favorability remains relatively low, AfD has made electoral gains recently, particularly in the former East. In Pew Research Center’s new survey, 24% of adults in the East express a favorable view of AfD, compared with 12% of those in the former West.

Views of two main centrist parties in Germany, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Social Democratic Party (SPD), are roughly the same in the former West and East Germany. Among adults in both the former West and East, 45% have a favorable view of the CDU, while 42% have a favorable opinion of the SPD.

Around two-thirds of adults in former West Germany (66%) have a favorable opinion of Alliance 90/The Greens, compared with 51% of those in the former East. Meanwhile, those in the former East are more likely than those in the former West (44% vs. 36%) to have a favorable view of The Left party, a successor to the Communist Party in the former German Democratic Republic. People in former West Germany are more likely than those in the former East not to offer an opinion on The Left.


Attitudes toward Jews have become much more favorable in Germany since 1991, especially in former West
Those in former East Germany hold more negative views toward certain minority groups than people in the former West. Majorities in both areas see Muslims and Jews favorably, but those living in the former East are 14 percentage points more likely than their Western counterparts to have an unfavorable view of Muslims (36% vs. 22%) and about twice as likely to have an unfavorable view of Jews (12% vs. 5%).

Views of another minority group – Roma – are decidedly more negative in both areas, but people in the former East are again more likely than those in the former West to express an unfavorable opinion (48% vs. 35%).

Over the long term, there have been some notable changes in views toward minority groups in both areas. In 1991, for example, around a quarter of those living in former West Germany (27%) expressed an unfavorable view toward Jews – about twice the share expressing that view in the former East (12%). Since then, views toward Jews have become much more favorable in both areas – especially in former West Germany, where around nine-in-ten (88%) now hold a favorable opinion, up from around half (51%) in 1991.



Religion is more important to people in the former West than those in the former East. Six-in-ten adults in former West Germany say religion is very or somewhat important in their lives, whereas an identical share of those in former East Germany say religion is not too or not at all important. This includes 45% of those in the former East who say religion is not at all important in their lives.

Similarly, a majority of adults in the former West (56%) agree with the statement “God plays an important role in my life,” while nearly three-quarters of those in the former East (72%) disagree with this statement.

While fewer than half of people in both areas agree with the statement “Prayer is an important part of my daily life,” those in the former West are more likely to agree with it than those in the former East (42% vs. 25%).

        "title" => "Homemade Ramen",
        "date" => "August 16, 2024",
        "content" => "When you want to cook to impress, few dinners can top homemade ramen. That being said, I'm not going to lie: making ramen from scratch requires time, patience, and a fair amount of effort. It can be a multi-day affair, and if you simply don’t have time for it, it can seem very intimidating. This shoyu ramen recipe calls for making four important components: dashi and tare for the soup base, and nitamago (marinated eggs) and chashu (pork belly) as showstopping toppings. You can certainly eat a decent bowl of noodles without one or two of these players, but man oh man, magic happens when they all come together in one bite. Trust me—your patience will be thoroughly rewarded after one spoonful of this homemade ramen. Here’s everything you need to know:

What People Are Saying:
This recipe is a masterpiece. It's extremely easy in the sense that no part of it requires any special skill. It takes some time to make and compile the various components, sure, but I did it all while do other things around the house today. I highly recommend making this!- timshead

How To Make Homemade Ramen
INGREDIENTS
• Chicken Dashi: This is simple, clear stock usually made with kombu (kelp), katsuobushi (dried fish shavings, aka bonito flakes). Making this takes just minutes because we don’t want to over-extract the intense flavors of these umami-rich ingredients, but if you need an even quicker version, many stores today carry an instant powder variety called Hon Dashi: Just add it to hot broth or water, and you’re good to go.
• Tare: Called the soul of ramen by some, tare is essentially a flavored, concentrated soy sauce. We will be making this once and using it three different ways: as braising liquid for the pork belly, as marinade for the eggs, and as seasoning for the soup.
• Chashu: This is braised pork belly, aka a little slice of heaven for my non-kosher friends. Seared then cooked gently and slowly in our tare mix, it might quite possibly be the most melt-in-your-mouth pork experience you’ll ever have. Pork belly with skin on is the best cut to use, but if you can’t find that at your local butcher, pork shoulder will do just fine.
• Nitamago: There is nothing more awe-inspiring than an egg done well. In this case, the eggs are soft-boiled, peeled, and left to chill in our tare marinade overnight, for 6 to 12 hours.
• La-yu: This ingredient is a bonus for my garlic-loving spice heads and it’s totally optional. Inspired by my favorite ramen condiment, found at Chuko in Brooklyn, this is a take on Japanese chili oil with savory pieces of garlic confit gummies and tiny pops of sesame. Just when you thought it couldn’t get better!
• Ramen Noodles: Use your favorite fresh ramen noodles here.

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS
To make the dashi, bring chicken broth up to a simmer in a pot, then once up to a simmer remove from heat, let cool for 2 minutes, then add the mushrooms and kombu. Once they are in for about 5 minutes, add in the bonito flakes, and steep for around 5 minutes. We want to stagger the ingredients so that all of the very pungent, aromantic ingredients don’t add an overwhelming flavor to the broth. Strain everything out, then reserve all of the solids to use in the ramen later.

Blanch the pork belly by adding to a pot, covering with water, then bringing to a simmer, and draining the water immediately. We don’t want to cook the meat, we just want to remove some of the not-as-fresh parts. Take the meat off the heat, drain it, and give it a quick rinse once done.

homemade ramenpinterest

To make the tare and chashu, add low-sodium soy sauce to a pot with the rest of your tare ingredients, and bring to a simmer. Once it is simmering, turn the heat to low, and add the pork. Cover, and let it cook on a low simmer until the pork is completely tender. You want to cook as slowly and gently as possible so that the meat stays tender and melt-in-your-mouth good. Check back occasionally, and give the pork a little turn as needed. To check if it is perfectly tender, I like to use a cake tester to check the tenderness. If it slides in very smoothly (think butter), then it is good to go. Remove the pork once it cools down slightly and let cool completely before slicing, and reserve the tare for later.

To make the nitamago, make jammy boiled eggs by boiling for around 6 minutes, then peeling them carefully. Place the peeled eggs in a bowl, and pour over the strained reserved tare over the eggs. Add the kombu as a cover to weigh down the eggs, then let sit in the fridge for 4-12 hours.

Now, we’re going to make the chili oil by adding oil and the mountain of garlic to a pot— bring to a simmer, and keep a close eye on it. Remove from the heat once it has started to reach a golden color, then add the ground chili or chili flakes. Let it rest for around 2 minutes—until the oil is nice and red—then stir in the sesame. Once cooled completely, store refrigerated in an airtight container for around 2 weeks.

After making your noodles and slicing your pork belly, all you have to do is assemble! Add your noodles to the bowl, pour over the dashi, add some spoonfuls of tare, slice and add your eggs and pork belly, and add your toppings! I went with green onions, homemade chili oil, and nori.

Full list of ingredients & instructions can be found in the recipe below.

Storage
This recipe makes enough broth and toppings for 4 servings and keeps well in the fridge for a week, so if you're cooking for one, it's the perfect thing to make on a Sunday and heat up throughout the week.

Directions

Save
printPrint
Make dashi (stock)
Step 1
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, bring chicken broth to a bare simmer. Remove from heat and let cool 2 minutes. Add in mushrooms and kombu (kelp) and let steep 5 minutes. Then, add in bonito and let steep 5 more minutes. Strain and save solids for nitamago process and serving.
Step 2
Store dashi chilled, up to 1 week.
Make tare and chashu (marinade and pork)
Step 1
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, bring all ingredients except pork to a low simmer and reduce heat to low.
Step 2
Meanwhile, in another medium pot over medium heat, bring pork and 6 cups water to a low simmer. Drain immediately and gently rinse pork. 
Step 3
Place pork in tare pot and bring to a simmer. Cover and continue to cook on low until tender, turning pork occasionally, about 1 hour 20 minutes.
Step 4
Let cool for 20 minutes, then strain and reserve liquid for serving. Refrigerate pork and remaining liquid separately. Slice pork before serving, lightly torched, if desired.
Make nitamago (marinated eggs)
Step 1
In a medium saucepan over high heat, bring 6 cups water to a rolling boil. Carefully prick rounded bottoms of each egg with a pin. Gently lower eggs into pot with a slotted spoon, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer eggs for 6 minutes. Drain.
Step 2
Transfer eggs to an ice bath and let rest for 5 minutes. Thoroughly crack eggshells very gently, knocking one egg against another, then return to ice bath for 10 more minutes. Peel carefully.
Step 3
Place eggs in a medium bowl and pour reserved pork-marinade liquid over. Weigh down eggs with reserved spent kombu (kelp) to fully immerse in liquid. Let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, up to 12 hours.
Make garlic la-yu (chili oil)
Step 1
In a small saucepan over the lowest possible heat, simmer garlic in oil until tender and translucent, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. Keep the heat level low enough to avoid frying the garlic.
Step 2
Remove from heat and immediately stir in chili. Let rest 2 minutes, then stir in sesame. 
Step 3
Once completely cool, store refrigerated in a closed container for up to 2 weeks.
To serve
Step 1
In a pot of salted boiling water, cook ramen, stirring with tongs or chopsticks until al dente, about 1 minute. (If using instant ramen, discard seasoning packet and follow packet instructions to cook until al dente.) Drain well.
Step 2
In a small saucepan over medium heat, warm dashi and shiitake until barely simmering. Cook for 1 minute and remove from heat. Set shiitake aside.
Step 3
Add dashi, tare, and noodles to serving bowl. Top with chashu, nitamago, shiitake, green onion, a drizzle of la-yu, and nori, if using.",
